# Self-driving-car

This's a project that fellow the JavaScript course from:

If you are interested in build awesome project you may subscribe that channel  

### The Demo is at https://pang-lee.github.io/pang-lee.JS_self_driving.github.io/
  
The code will appear as the course progresses and will be divided into parts as follows:
  1. Car driving mechanics
  2. Road definition
  3. Artificial sensors
  4. Collision detection
  5. Traffic simulation
  6. Neural network
  7. Visualizing neural networks
  8. Optimizing neural networks
  9. Fine-tuning

  The final project would be Fine-tuning file
