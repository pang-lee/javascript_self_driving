This's a project that fellow the JavaScript course from:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI&t=4212s  
If you are interested in build awesome project you may subscribe that channel  

### The Demo is at https://pang-lee.github.io/pang-lee.JS_self_driving.github.io/
  
The code will appear as the course progresses and will be divided into parts as follows:
  1. Car driving mechanics
  2. Road definition
  3. Artificial sensors
  4. Collision detection
  5. Traffic simulation
  6. Neural network
  7. Visualizing neural networks
  8. Optimizing neural networks
  9. Fine-tuning

  The final project would be Fine-tuning file  
  You can also play this project using keyboard arrow key  
  all you need is change the car.js file line 15 to 'KEY'  
  This file have to store the AI bias and weight inside your browser localstorage
